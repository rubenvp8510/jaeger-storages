An open source Golang client for Druid


**Node:** This project is not yet beta released. It should certainly contains bugs, and the apis could change in any time. So please be really careful if you choose to use it in production. Currently the [groupBy](http://druid.io/docs/latest/GroupByQuery.html) and [topN](http://druid.io/docs/latest/TopNQuery.html) queries are used in our production.

Any bug fixes, issues, contributions, questions are welcome.
